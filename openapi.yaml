                                        bigger the priority.

                                        Percentage of local traffic load
                                        balanced to tag is computed by dividing
                                        weight by sum of weights from all tags.

                                        For example with two affinity tags first
                                        with weight 80 and second with weight
                                        20,

                                        then 80% of traffic will be redirected
                                        to the first tag, and 20% of traffic
                                        will be redirected to second one.

                                        Setting weights is not mandatory. When
                                        weights are not set control plane will
                                        compute default weight based on list
                                        order.

                                        Default: If you do not specify weight we
                                        will adjust them so that 90% traffic
                                        goes to first tag, 9% to next, and 1% to
                                        third and so on.

                                  outgoing traffic.

                                  transparent - resources generated for
                                  transparent proxy functionality.

                                  prometheus - resources generated when
                                  Prometheus metrics are enabled.

                                  direct-access - resources generated for Direct
                                  Access functionality.

                                  ingress - resources generated for Zone
                                  Ingress.

                                  egress - resources generated for Zone Egress.

                                  gateway - resources generated for MeshGateway.

                                  plugins can introduce new resources.

                                  Cluster with "mesh-trace" origin.

                                  egress - resources generated for Zone Egress.

                                  gateway - resources generated for MeshGateway.

                      Tags specifies a unique combination of tags that routes
                      can use

                      to match themselves to this listener.


                      When matching routes to listeners, the control plane
                      constructs a

                      set of matching tags for each listener by forming the
                      union of the

                      gateway tags and the listener tags. A route will be
                      attached to the

                      listener if all of the route's tags are preset in the
                      matching tags

                          contain a

        token page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/account/tokens/) in the
        Konnect dashboard.
