## Schema

### Required

- `addresses` (List of String) Which address or addresses to listen on.
`0.0.0.0` means all addresses on the host.
`::` means all addresses on the host in IPv6.

  If `0.0.0.0` or `::` is used, there can't be other extra addresses defined.
  WARNING: there are use cases where listening on all addresses is insecure. So use this with caution.

  `localhost` means only the localhost ipv4 address.
- `gateway_id` (String) The UUID of your Gateway.
- `name` (String) The unique name of the listener.
- `ports` (Attributes List) Which port or ports to listen on.
There can be multiple ways to define ports:
  - as a single port, e.g. 9092
  - as a range of ports, e.g. 9092-9094

It's possible to combine both, e.g. [9092, "9093-9095", 9096]. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ports))

### Optional

- `description` (String) A human-readable description of the virtual cluster.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels store metadata of an entity that can be used for filtering an entity list or for searching across entity types. 

Keys must be of length 1-63 characters, and cannot start with "kong", "konnect", "mesh", "kic", or "_".

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) An ISO-8601 timestamp representation of entity creation date.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the listener.
- `updated_at` (String) An ISO-8601 timestamp representation of entity update date.

<a id="nestedatt--ports"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ports`

Optional:

- `integer` (Number)
- `str` (String)

## Import
