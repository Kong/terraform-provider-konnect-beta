## Schema

### Optional

- `konnect_access_token` (String, Sensitive) The Konnect access token is meant to be used by the Konnect dashboard and the decK CLI authenticate with.
.
- `personal_access_token` (String, Sensitive) The personal access token is meant to be used as an alternative to basic-auth when accessing Konnect via APIs.
You can generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the [personal access token page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/account/tokens/) in the Konnect dashboard.
The PAT token must be passed in the header of a request, for example:
`curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header 'Authorization: Bearer kpat_xgfT...'`
. Configurable via environment variable `KONNECT_TOKEN`.
- `server_url` (String) Server URL (defaults to https://global.api.konghq.com)
- `system_account_access_token` (String, Sensitive) The system account access token is meant for automations and integrations that are not directly associated with a human identity.
You can generate a system account Access Token by creating a system account and then obtaining a system account access token for that account.
The access token must be passed in the header of a request, for example:
`curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header 'Authorization: Bearer spat_i2Ej...'`
. Configurable via environment variable `KONNECT_SPAT`.
